# Semantic Memory Models

Agent Memory Hub v0.4.0 introduces typed, semantic memory models. This allows you to work with structured concepts like "Events", "Facts", and "Profiles" rather than raw JSON blobs.

## Philosophy

By enforcing schema on memory, we enable:

1.  **Reliable Extraction**: Ensure memories generated by LLMs conform to a known structure.
2.  **Smarter Retrieval**: Filter by type (e.g., "Give me all facts about Python").
3.  **Knowledge Graphs**: Link memories together using IDs and source references.

## Available Models

### 1. EpisodicMemory

Records an event, conversation turn, or tool execution.

- `content`: The textual description of what happened.
- `source`: E.g., "conversation", "calendar", "tool_trace".
- `participants`: List of actor IDs involved.

### 2. SemanticMemory

Represents a distinctive fact or piece of knowledge (Subject-Predicate-Object).

- `subject`: "User"
- `predicate`: "prefers"
- `object`: "Dark Mode"
- `truth_score`: 0.0 to 1.0 confidence.

### 3. EntityMemory

A profile for a stable entity.

- `entity_id`: Unique reference (e.g., "user_123").
- `attributes`: Dictionary of traits (age, name, role).

## Usage Example

```python
from agent_memory_hub import MemoryClient
from agent_memory_hub.models import EpisodicMemory, SemanticMemory, MemoryScope

client = MemoryClient(agent_id="researcher", session_id="sess_1")

# 1. Store a Fact
fact = SemanticMemory(
    agent_id="researcher",
    subject="Python",
    predicate="released_year",
    object="1991",
    scope=MemoryScope.GLOBAL,
    tags=["programming", "history"]
)
client.write_model(fact)

# 2. Store an Episode
episode = EpisodicMemory(
    agent_id="researcher",
    content="User asked about Python history.",
    participants=["user_1", "researcher"]
)
client.write_model(episode)
```
